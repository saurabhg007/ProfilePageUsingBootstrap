# ProfilePageUsingBootstrap
The "Profile Page Using Bootstrap" project involves creating a webpage that displays an individual's personal or professional profile. 
It utilizes Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design. 
The profile page typically includes sections for the person's name, profile picture, bio, contact information, and social media links. 
Bootstrap components and classes are employed to structure and style the content, ensuring it looks great on various screen sizes and devices. 
This project aims to showcase the use of Bootstrap for creating a polished and functional profile page for online resumes, portfolios, or personal websites.
